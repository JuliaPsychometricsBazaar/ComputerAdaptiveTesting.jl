## Examples

You can browse through the examples below. Each example has code and outputs,
as well as links to download a script to run locally or to view as a Jupyter
notebook on NBViewer. Some of the examples have interactive plots, and these
will not currently work unless the scripts are run locally. TODO: Add binder
links to examples.

If you would like to run the examples as Jupyter notebooks locally to see
interactive plots inline with the code, you can clone the repository and run
`docs/build_nbs.jl` like so:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/frankier/ComputerAdaptiveTesting.jl.git
$ cd ComputerAdaptiveTesting
$ julia --project=. docs/build_nbs.jl
```
