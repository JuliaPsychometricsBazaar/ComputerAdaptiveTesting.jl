# Getting started

This is the documentation for
[ComputerAdaptiveTesting](https://github.com/frankier/ComputerAdaptiveTesting.jl).
For information about the purpose of the package and its installation, please
[see the
README.md](https://github.com/frankier/ComputerAdaptiveTesting.jl/blob/main/README.md).

The documentation is currently mainly limited to [Examples](@ref) and an [API
reference](@ref). The currently recommended way to get started is by hacking an
existing example.
